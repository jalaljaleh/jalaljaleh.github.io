4K-ready Minimal Resume Site (Light / Pastel)
--------------------------------------------
Files:
- index.html (Hero + About + Contact + Footer)
- css/main.css (4K-optimized styles)
- js/main.js (form demo + smooth scrolling)
- assets/profile-1600.jpg and profile-600.jpg (high-res profile photos derived from your upload)

Notes:
- Replace every 'NULL' placeholder with your real data.
- To preview locally, serve the folder with a static server:
    python -m http.server 8000
  Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.
- The site is designed for very large displays (4K). Font sizes and image sizes are scaled accordingly.
